		    <h3>Quotes about Autumn</h3>
            <q>It looked like the world was covered in a cobbler crust of brown sugar and cinnamon.</q><hr>
		    <q>You expected to be sad in the fall. Part of you died each year when the leaves fell from the
            trees and their branches were bare against the wind and the cold, wintery light. But you knew
            there would always be the spring, as you knew the river would flow again after it was frozen.
            When the cold rains kept on and killed the spring, it was as though a young person died for no
            reason.</q><hr>
            <q>I would rather sit on a pumpkin, and have it all to myself,
            than be crowded on a velvet cushion.</q><hr>
            <q>Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first September was crisp
            and golden as an apple.</q><hr>
            <q>No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace as I have seen in one autumnal face.</q>

            <p>Ural State Academy of Architecture and Arts organized and hosted the very first Ural
            International Forum Design from April 1 to April 3, 2015, as part of StartUp Design Week.
            The main goal of the event was to create a way to communicate between young design
            professionals and experts in the architecture and business industries. Attendees included
            representatives from large companies like D-link, Convex, Salt, Wacom, IC ARCHITECT,
            Schneider Electric and others. The panel of judges included teachers, potential investors,
            entrepreneurs and experts from the MBA academy. Two contestants won best report, one of
            which was Anna Prokhorova, who created "personal products for the diagnosis and prevention
            of depression." This project has stirred a sizable controversy about the topic. Many
            activities took place at the event, including a panel that discussed "Modern vectors of
            design and architecture," a lecture about "National policy in the field of design," as well
            as several presentations from design professionals and design students.</p>

		    <h3>Ural Airlines modifies rewards program</h3>
            <p>As Ural Airlines' Wings customer loyalty program has grown, the company has found it
            necessary to re-number program cards. Previously, members were assigned a seven-digit number.
            Those numbers will now contain 10 digits; existing members should just add a "100" prefix to
            their seven-digit number. For example, card number 1234567 would become 1001234567. Current
            Wings members can verify new account numbers by logging on to www.uralairlines.com and
            clicking the dashboard online. Once logged into your profile, click the "membership cards" tab.
            Those interested in signing up for a Wings account can do so at the same website. Wings
            participants can accumulate bonus points that can be used for free tickets and upgrades.</p>
            <h3>URFU hosts annual natural history festival</h3>
            <p>Ural Federal University's (URFU) Institute of Natural Sciences recently hosted a festival
            event to celebrate the IV Traditional Festival of Earth and Universe. The theme of the event
            was "Lasers Everywhere" in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize going to
            A. M. Prokhorov, Charles Townes and N. G. Basov; their work in quantum electronics, amplifiers 
            and oscillators significantly contributed to the invention of the laser. Scientists from URFU
            explained to students that lasers can be used in many industries, including biology, physics,
            medicine, chemistry and astronomy. Alexander Germanenko, the head of the department of
            computer physics, presented a half-hour lecture about popular science titled "What is a laser"?
            Students then had the opportunity to break into study groups and learn how to use lasers in
            biology, physics, medicine, chemistry and astronomy. They also took a quiz about lasers. The
            students were also required to create several proposals about applying lasers in their
            industries. These ideas were given to a board of jury members. The winner will be announced at
            the next festival. Founded in 1920 and located in Yekarerinburg, URFU is the oldest university
            in the Ural region. It has 5,640 academic staff members and 57,000 students.</p>
